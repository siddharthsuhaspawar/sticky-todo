## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Sticky ToDo embraces **less is more**:

- **Typography**: Elegant serif for branding, clean sans-serif for readability
- **Colors**: Carefully crafted dark/light palettes with proper contrast
- **Motion**: Subtle animations that feel responsive and delightful
- **Focus**: No unnecessary features - just a simple, beautiful todo list

| `Esc` | Clear input / close search |
| `Space/Enter` | Toggle task completion (when checkbox is focused) |

## 💾 Data Storage
